# Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! I implemented the neural network from scratch by implementing the gradient descent step and backpropagation through the network.

# Installation

For best experience with managing dependency I advise you install [Anconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html).

Create a virtual environment with conda
```
conda create --name deep-learning python=3
```
Activate environment.
```
conda activate deep-learning
```

Install dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download or clone this predicting-bike-sharing-patterns repository. Launch the app with jupyter-notebook.
```
jupyter-notebook Your_first_neural_network.py
```

# Usage

### Run
Run all code cells in the notebook. Optionally have a look at the file `my_answers.py`.
